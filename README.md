In order to recreate this output, go into the Artificial directory in the code repository.
Then run the cornerdetection.m file. The resulting MATLAB plot should look like the image above.

In order to recreate this output, go into the Artificial directory in the code repository.
Then run the tomasi_kanade.m file. The resulting MATLAB 3D plot with the point cloud should look like the image above.


REALISTIC PIPELINE:

In order to recreate this output, go into the Realistic directory in the code repository. 
Then run the preprocessing.m file before running the pipeline.m file. This should result in a folder of enhanced images as well as the 3D point cloud.
